# MidiDrumHero
 A bridge between E-Kits, Midi Keyboards and Clone Hero

### Unless you're using it for keys, mididrumhero is pretty much obsolete now that Clone Hero's built-in MIDI support has been improved. Go give it a try!

## Usage
#### MidiDrumHero can be used for electronic drum kits as well as Midi keyboards

### Installation
- [Download and install vJoy for Windows 10 Only](https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases)
- [Download and install vJoy for other Windows versions](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy/releases)
- [Download MidiDrumHero](https://github.com/ejj28/mididrumhero/releases/latest) and install

### Usage
- Select your Midi device, click **Monitor** and hit your drum pads/keyboard keys to find the Midi note values of the drum pads/keys you would like to map
- Return to **Dashboard**, and for each pad/key, click the **New Drum Pad** button and enter:
    - The Midi note number of the pad/key
    - The button number the pad/key will show up as in Clone Hero's settings, it doesn't matter what number you use, as long as you use 1 to 8 and use a different number for each pad/key unless you want multiple pads/keys to correspond to the same pad/key in-game
    - The velocity at which you would like to set the drum hit/key press threshold at. A good default value is 10; if your drums/keys are sensitive and are registering erroneous hits, adjust the sesitivity as needed.
- When done adding the pad/key, press the Save button
- If using a Midi keyboard or similar Midi device, turn on the Keys Mode switch on the dashboard

As soon as a Midi device has been selected, MidiDrumHero will begin reading drum hits/key presses from your E-Kit or Midi keyboard and sending them to Clone Hero. Simply map your drums/keyboard in Clone Hero and play!
